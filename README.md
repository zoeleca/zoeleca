# ZOE LECAILLE __ WEB DEVELOPER
<em>Looking for an Apprenticeship (12 months) starting from July 2024</em>

### Bonjour 🖐️
I'm Zoe, a Developper Student at Ada Tech School in Paris.
After graduating from Korean Studies in Inalco, I decided to take a gap year to focus on my future career. 
It's in New Zealand that I came accross professional working in the Tech and started an exciting journey towards becoming a Developper. 

I develop mainly using JavaScript. But I have also started using PHP, Python and tools such as React. Have a look at my repos to see what I'm curently working on !
