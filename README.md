I'm Zoe, a <strong>Coffee Enthusiast</strong> and a <strong>Developper Student</strong> at Ada Tech School in Paris.<br>
<br>
After graduating from Korean Studies in Inalco, I decided to take a gap year to rethink about my future career. <br>
It's in New Zealand that I came accross professional working in the Tech and started an exciting journey towards becoming a Developper. <br>
<br>
<br>
I develop mainly using JavaScript. But I have started using PHP, Python and tools such as React.
