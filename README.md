### Beyond the code

I’m a Software Engineer at [**Swan**](https://www.swan.io/) in Paris (mainly back-end).
I see software as a craft, I’m deeply curious about how to build things that aren't just powerful, but are thoughtfully designed and easy for other developers to read.

**A few things about me:**

* **Software as a Craft:** I’m a big advocate for "clean as you go." I find peace in a well-tested codebase and enjoy the logic of functional programming with `fp-ts`.
* **The Ritual:** I’m a specialty coffee enthusiast. To me, dialing in a new bag for a V60 pour is the perfect morning ritual before opening a terminal. 
* **The Great Outdoors:** When the screen gets to be too much, I head for the trails. I love hiking—it’s where I do my best "offline" problem-solving.

### At Swan
I’ve been with the Customer-Oriented Development team for over a year and a half. My days are a mix of building new tools for our users and jumping on fixes to keep their experience as seamless as possible.

* **Feature Development:** Designing and shipping new functionalities from end-to-end.
* **Code Health:** Maintaining a complex codebase and proactively fixing bugs to ensure stability.
* **Engineering Standards:** Implementing **Separation of Concerns** and **TDD** (Vitest/Supertest) to keep our logic modular and testable.
